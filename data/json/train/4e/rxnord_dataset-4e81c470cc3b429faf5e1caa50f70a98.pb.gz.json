LC-2-1 was synthesized according to a method described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication \u201cTokkaihei\u201d No. 2001-166147. LC-2-2 was synthesized by dissolving a commercial hydroxyethyl methacrylate, acrylic acid, and M5610 (product of Daikin Industries, Ltd.) in a ratio by weight of 15/5/80 into methyl ethyl ketone (concentration 40%), and the mixture was allowed to polymerize using V-601 (product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) as a polymerization initiator. LC-2-3 was synthesized by first introducing octyloxybenzoic acid (product of Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) into an excessive hydroquinone (product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) based on the mixed acid anhydride process so as to obtain monoacyl phenol compound. Next, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate was converted to a hydroxyl ethyl compound using ethylene carbonate, the resultant ester is hydrolyzed, and brominated with hydrobromic acid to obtain 2-bromoethyloxybenzoic acid. Two these compounds were then esterified by the mixed acid anhydride process to obtain a diester compound, and the product was then converted to a quaternary compound using dimethylaminopyridine, to thereby obtain LC-2-3 as an onium salt."
